factory floor managment project
synopsis

Introduction: If we are talking about the smart factory than machine deployed there must consume power as per the required demand, as well as their maintenance, should be as per the requirement not based on scheduled maintenance and they should be monitored properly and smartly, their current condition is up-to-date and if required than alarm and shutdown the machine, this reduces the money as well as the factory shutdown time so that the production can be maintained and demand fulfilled.

Objectives: We are focusing on these main fields -
	(1) Machine Failure – We are monitoring machines based on some main requirements like 	power consumption mainly                                        current as normal machines have to fix current demand but when a fault occurs like heating, vibration, high load, lubrication, and insulation, etc.

	(2) Surrounding – In industry humidity, temperature, and gases affect the machine’s performance and it’s health.

	(3) Reduced cost - A healthy machine can increase the profitability of production. As well as their maintenance cost is reduced and service is high which is achieved by their real and run time monitoring along with required maintenance.

Hardware & Sensor used: In this, we are using the SW420 Vibration sensor, ACS712 Current sensor, MQ2 Smoke sensor, DHT11 sensor, MAX6675 thermocouple sensor.

Software and Technology used: Arduino, MQTT, Node-js, MongoDB, Angular and Web programming.

Platforms Used: Amazon web services (AWS).

Language Tools: C, Python, Node-js.
